Invaders Project

Brief

For the invaders game l changed quite a few things with the intention of making the 
game harder for the player, by having the player use two ships at the same time sharing
one health bar. I hoped to make the game rely on mouse control for shooting so the ship 
would rotate to the pointed direction to shoot and bounce projectiles off the walls. Since
l have no knowledge in programming so the game remains a dream.

Game Description

The game is a 2d shooter where you fend off alien invaders using your weapons however be wary 
captain the enemy will not stand idly by so keep on your toes and avoid their projectiles.

Game Mechanics

There is not much change in the game mechanics compared to the original copy of the invaders 
game, the only difference is that you can destroy the enemies faster than intended and at this 
point it’s far too late to tinker with the code so l hand it in as it is. The gameplay has some 
bugs if for example the ships touch either left of right border continuously it causes the ship 
to overlap on top of each other as they pushed towards each other.

Control 

The game uses the standard arrow keys and the space bar key to shot the missiles.
UI
The game is coloured in cyan blue to sell a science fiction narrative, a very popular hue for 
eccentric design as well as comfortable to the eye and not mundane.

Modifications

To modify the game l had help from Matthew Duddington and Hung-Li Chou at adding a new ship 
sprite, understanding some of the syntax and purposes of functions such as the array, classes, 
functions and especially the reason of declaring code. Lastly l replaced “whoosh” sound with a 
gushing air sound which reminded me of cargo being jettisoned in space games.
